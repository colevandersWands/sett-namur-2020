          <h2>familiarizer vous avec les malcompréhentions fréquants</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            many misunderstandings don't result in bad assignments <br>
            there are some very common ones you can come prepared for <br>
            this will also help you learn enormously <br>

          <h3>2.</h3>
          <h2>choisissez d'abord l'environnement, <br> puis le language</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            changing is very disruptive <br>
            many of the questions you'll get are about where they code, not even the code <br>
            this is an oportunity to relevantize to your domain/subject <br>

          <h3>3.</h3>
          <h2>pratiquez le debugging <br> plus que le coding</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            students can be left to figure out their own solutions <br>
            but being stuck on errors is not so motivating or productive <br>
            it will also give you much more confidence, in my experience <br>
            it's easier to say with a straight face when i can't actually help: <br>
            you're here to learn how to solve these tough problems <br>
            than, you're here to spend 20 minutes staring at broken errors <br>

          <h3>4.</h3>
          <h2>commencez avec du code fini</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            small chagnes are big changes <br>
            repeated similar tasks (as long as they aren't boaring) are effecive <br>
            better-contain questions & problems to things you're familiar with <br>
            writing code from scratch is far from the only good way to learn it <br>
            and may even be a bad way <br>
            either code they, you or someone else has written <br>
            draw diagrams to explain the code <br>
            give a simple starter program and have pairs go back-and-forth adding to it <br>
            write stories about where/how it's helpful <br>
            ...

          <h2>pseudo-data au lieu du pseudo-code</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            practice stepping through the solution process on multiple examples<br>
            instead of talking about possible solution code<br>
            more immediate, better look 'behind the scenes'<br>
            more transferable outside of coding<br>

          <h2>utilise les platforms déjà existant</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            you already know how difficult it is to scope a lesson plan and stay within it <br>
            this is at least as hard with programming <br>
            don't hesitate to fall-back on existing curriculums & materials <br>
            they'll be a self-contained ecosystem <br>
            and can leave you more headspace to focus on integrating with your subject <br>
